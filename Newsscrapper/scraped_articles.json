The result is a striking collection of photographs and text titled \"A Place Called Home,\" in which she seeks to challenge common preconceptions about squatters -- and explore the idea that home is more a feeling than a physical place.\n\nHaving moved into her new home in a squat in Kentish Town, north London, Kern had to figure out how to coexist in one building with 30 people and three dogs. She also found herself part of a wider alternative community that's both transient and close-knit.\n\nThrough the connections she made, she visited six other squats in north and south London. One was in a former fabric warehouse, another in an abandoned garden center, a third in a white-walled former design studio.\n\n\"As the squatting scene is very interconnected, I came to discover how diverse squats can be, both in their visual appearance and emotional vibe,\" she said. \"The unusualness of the different places, which may not comply with the idea of home in the common sense, intrigued me and shaped my project.\"\n\nAll the squats Kern visited were in former commercial premises. A law enacted in September 2012 made it illegal to squat in residential properties.\n\nI came to discover how diverse squats can be, both in their visual appearance and emotional vibe. Corinna Kern\n\nWith housing costs high in London and affordable options in short supply, squatting can seem an appealing option to some people -- although, as Kern points out, it's not a lifestyle chosen simply because of homelessness or poverty.\n\n\"What might commonly be perceived as a shelter for the homeless or poor is often a conscious choice of an alternative and communal way of living,\" she writes in the text accompanying her images.\n\n\"The squatting lifestyle attracts many individuals on their search for adventure, freedom, friendship and self-discovery. Yet, it demands sacrifices and the ability to change and adapt.\"\n\nThe squatters' campaign group SQUASH (Squatters' Action for Secure Homes) says no one knows how many squatters there are nationwide at any one time. But it is clear that tens of thousands of people in the UK have squatted at one time or another, it says.\n\nSocial media Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography.\n\nThe Empty Homes Agency, an independent charity group that campaigns for empty homes to be used for those in need, estimates that there are currently 610,000 empty homes in England. About one-third of these homes have been empty for six or more months, it says.\n\nBut since it's now illegal to squat in residential properties, empty or not, squatters have turned to London's disused commercial buildings, many of which have been left empty long-term.\n\nWhen squatters move in, they bring a new life to the space, often surprising in its incongruity. In one of Kern's photographs, taken inside the disused fabric warehouse, a man rests on a shelf used for storing rolls of cloth. He's hard to spot at first among the jumble of multicolored fabric.\n\nOther images show \"The Castle,\" a former five-story office block in central London that is now a home for more than 100 squatters -- and a site for raves. Graffiti covers the walls, and party detritus is scattered across the floor where office workers once walked.\n\nAnother of Kern's photographs, taken in a squat in a former cabaret restaurant, shows a young man and woman, semi-clothed and hard at work to repair and alter their surroundings using cloth and wood.\n\nFor her project, Kern says, she used only a wide-angle lens to reflect the closeness of her subjects. \"The use of natural light adds to a candid feel,\" she said, adding to the authenticity of the images.\n\n\"I visually tried to convey the very different vibes of the squats that became homes, according to both their residents and the nature of the occupied spaces. Especially for the squat that I stayed at, I focused largely on the communal lifestyle in order to convey a sense of home.\"\n\nFar from encountering resistance as she ventured into people's intimate space, Kern says she made many friends. This was in part because she won people's trust by living among them -- but also because her project aimed to celebrate the positive aspects of their lifestyle rather than reinforce the negative stereotypes of squatters as wasters, tax dodgers or down-and-outs.\n\n\"My fellow squatters knew that I was a photographer documenting the squatting lifestyle, since I was always carrying my camera with me,\" she said.\n\n\"The squatters were very welcoming when I first met them, became my friends, hence the majority reacted positively towards me taking photographs.\"\n\nDespite the privations that come with squatting in buildings that often have no electricity or running water, Kern says she would do it again -- although she wants to try out the many other alternative lifestyles out there first.\n\nFrom her images and her words, it's clear she found her time in a squat an overwhelmingly rewarding experience.\n\n\"You may not have a shower, but you may gain the most amazing rooftop views,\" she writes. \"You may have to share your room with seven other people, but you may share your happiest moments with them. You may have to move 10 times a year, but the diverse places and people you meet become an integral part of your journey through life, turning it into anything but ordinary.\"", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/2015/02/08/living/cnnphotos-a-place-called-home/index.html", "published": "2015-02-08T00:00:00"}]}, "bbc": {"rss": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/rss.xml", "link": "http://www.bbc.com/", "articles": [{"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-48946051", "published": "2019-07-11T14:11:47", "title": "Strait of Hormuz: Iranian boats 'tried to intercept British tanker'", "text": "Image copyright Reuters Image caption HMS Montrose was shadowing a British tanker as it moved into the Strait of Hormuz\n\nIranian boats tried to impede a British oil tanker near the Gulf - before being driven off by a Royal Navy ship, the Ministry of Defence has said.\n\nHMS Montrose, a British frigate shadowing the BP-owned tanker, was forced to move between the three boats and the tanker, a spokesman said.\n\nHe described the Iranians' actions as \"contrary to international law\".\n\nIran had threatened to retaliate for the seizure of one of its own tankers, but denied any attempted seizure.\n\nBoats believed to belong to Iran's Islamic Revolution Guard Corps (IRGC) approached the tanker, British Heritage, and tried to bring it to a halt as it was moving out of the Gulf into the Strait of Hormuz.\n\nGuns on HMS Montrose were trained on the Iranian boats as they were ordered to back off, US media reported. The boats heeded the warning and no shots were fired.\n\nThe BBC has been told British Heritage was near the island of Abu Musa when it was approached by the Iranian boats.\n\nAlthough Abu Musa is in disputed territorial waters, HMS Montrose remained in international waters throughout.\n\nDefence Secretary Penny Mordaunt said the government was concerned by the incident and urged the Iranian authorities to \"de-escalate the situation\".\n\nForeign Secretary Jeremy Hunt added the UK would monitor the situation \"very carefully\".\n\nPrime Minister Theresa May's official spokesman said the government was \"committed to maintaining freedom of navigation in accordance with international law\".\n\nWhat does Iran say?\n\nThe navy of Iran's Islamic Revolution Guard Corps has denied claims it tried to seize the tanker, Iranian news agencies reported. IRGC's navy said there had been no confrontation with any foreign vessels in the past 24 hours.\n\nIranian foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said the UK made the claims \"for creating tension\".\n\n\"These claims have no value,\" Mr Zarif added, according to the Fars news agency.\n\nWhy are UK-Iran tensions escalating?\n\nImage copyright EPA Image caption Two tankers were attacked in the Strait of Hormuz in June\n\nThe relationship between the UK and Iran has become increasingly strained, after Britain said the Iranian regime was \"almost certainly\" responsible for the attacks on two oil tankers in June.\n\nLast week, British Royal Marines helped the authorities in Gibraltar seize an oil tanker because of evidence it was carrying Iranian crude oil to Syria in breach of EU sanctions.\n\nOn Thursday an Iranian official told the BBC the seizure was \"unnecessary and non-constructive escalation by the UK\".\n\nThe official claimed the oil was not bound for Syria and called for the tanker to be released.\n\nThe government of Gibraltar said it would not comment on matters relating to the vessel as it was the subject of a police investigation. It said the matter was also now in the Supreme Court.\n\nThe Port of Gibraltar's live map showed the tanker, Grace 1, remained anchored about 3km off the east coast of Gibraltar.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption British Royal Marines helped to detain the oil tanker, Grace 1, near Gibraltar earlier this month\n\nAt the time of the Gibraltar incident, Iran summoned the British ambassador in Tehran to complain about what it said was a \"form of piracy\".\n\nAn Iranian official said a British oil tanker should be seized if Grace 1 was not released.\n\nOn Wednesday, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani mocked the UK, calling it \"scared\" and \"hopeless\" for using Royal Navy warships to shadow another British tanker in the Gulf.\n\nHMS Montrose had shadowed the British tanker Pacific Voyager for some of the way through the Strait of Hormuz, but that journey had passed without incident.\n\n\"You, Britain, are the initiator of insecurity and you will realise the consequences later,\" Mr Rouhani said.\n\nThe UK has also been pressing Iran to release British-Iranian mother Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe who was jailed for five years in 2016 after being convicted for spying, which she denies.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Why does the Strait of Hormuz matter?\n\nThe Royal Navy has a frigate, four minehunters and a Royal Fleet Auxiliary support ship already stationed in a permanent Naval Support Facility in the region, at Mina Salman in Bahrain.\n\nThis is enough to provide reassurance, but probably not to deal with a crisis, BBC defence correspondent Jonathan Beale said.\n\n\"HMS Montrose will not be able to provide protection for every commercial vessel in the Gulf with links to the UK,\" he added.\n\n\"Ministers will now have to contemplate sending another Royal Navy warship to the region. But in doing so, that may only further escalate tensions with Iran, which is something the government wants to avoid.\"\n\nThe Ministry of Defence confirmed Royal Marines were on board HMS Montrose and said this was normal for frigates and destroyers deployed to the Gulf.\n\nCan ships in the area avoid Iranian waters?\n\nThe Strait of Hormuz, through which all ships must pass to enter the Gulf, is so narrow - just 21 nautical miles (39km) at its narrowest - that Iranian and Omani territorial waters meet in the middle.\n\nSo instead of sailing through international waters, ships must pass through Iranian or Omani territory which both extend 12 nautical miles out from their coasts.\n\nShips do this under something called Rights of Straits Passage - part of a UN convention which gives ships free passage through the world's chokepoints like the Strait of Gibraltar and the Malacca Strait.\n\nIn the case of the Strait of Hormuz, shipping is channelled through two lanes heading in opposite directions, each one two nautical miles wide.\n\nThis is called the Traffic Separation Scheme.\n\nBoth Iran and the US Navy deploy warships to patrol this area and have narrowly avoided confrontation on several occasions.\n\nOnce ships pass through the Strait of Hormuz and enter the Gulf they need to be wary of a contested area around the islands of Abu Musa and the Greater and Lesser Tunbs.\n\nThese are claimed by both Iran and the UAE but occupied solely by Iranian forces.\n\nCould the UK-Iran situation get worse?\n\nIran appears to have been attempting to make good on its threat against British-flagged vessels in the wake of the seizure of an Iranian tanker off Gibraltar.\n\nBut though this incident has a specifically bilateral dimension, it is also a powerful reminder that the tensions in the Gulf have not gone away.\n\nAnd with every sign that the dispute over the nuclear agreement with Iran is set to continue, things may only get worse.\n\nThe episode may add some impetus to US-brokered efforts to muster an international naval force in the Gulf to protect international shipping.\n\nBut most worrying of all, it shows that elements within the Iranian system - the Revolutionary Guard Corps's naval arm, or whatever - are intent on stoking the pressure.\n\nThis inevitably plays into President Trump's hands as Britain and its key European partners struggle to keep the nuclear agreement alive.\n\nWhat we know about British Heritage\n\nIt is understood British Heritage was not carrying cargo at the time of the incident with the Iranian boats.\n\nA spokesman for BP said: \"Our top priority is the safety and security of our crews and vessels.\n\n\"While we are not commenting on these events, we thank the Royal Navy for their support.\"\n\nThe vessel is registered at the port of Douglas, in the Isle of Man.\n\nWhat are US-Iran tensions about?\n\nThe US has blamed Iran for attacks on six oil tankers in May and June.\n\nOn Wednesday the chairman of the US military's Joint Chiefs of Staff said it wanted to create a multi-national military coalition to safeguard waters around Iran and Yemen.\n\nThe news followed the Trump administration's decision to pull out of an international agreement on Tehran's nuclear programme and reinforce punishing sanctions against Iran.\n\nEuropean allies to the US, including the UK, have not followed suit.\n\nIran's ambassador to the UN has insisted Europeans must do more to compensate Tehran for economic losses inflicted by US sanctions.\n\nTehran has begun to nudge the levels of its enriched uranium beyond the limits of a nuclear deal agreed with a group of world powers, in small and calculated steps.\n\nMajid Takht-Ravanchi told the BBC, Iran would move to the \"third phase\" of its stepped-up uranium enrichment programme unless the Europeans kept promises to uphold the economic benefits of the accord."}, {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-48950672", "published": "2019-07-11T14:47:42", "title": "Tommy Robinson jailed for contempt of court", "text": "Image copyright Getty Images\n\nTommy Robinson has been jailed for nine months over contempt of court.\n\nThe ex-English Defence League leader was found guilty last week of interfering with the trial of a sexual grooming gang at Leeds Crown Court in May 2018.\n\nTwo Old Bailey judges said his Facebook Live video of defendants in the trial had encouraged \"vigilante action\".\n\nA social media account in Robinson's name called the sentence an \"absolute joke\" and said it was time to protest.\n\nOutside the London court, supporters of Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, booed as news of his sentence reached them.\n\nThe crowd marched towards the Old Bailey chanting \"we want Tommy out\" before some began pelting police with bottles and cans.\n\nAs a prison van thought to contain Robinson drove away, several supporters shouted \"we love you, Tommy\".\n\nSome of his supporters then moved towards Parliament where there were reports of journalists being verbally abused and physically intimidated.\n\nCity of London Police said officers arrested four people for alleged offences committed on Friday, the day of Robinson's conviction.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nDuring the 2018 case at Leeds Crown Court, reporting restrictions had been put in place postponing the publication of any details until the end of a series of linked trials involving 29 defendants.\n\nHowever, Robinson, 36, from Luton, broadcast footage from outside the court on 25 May 2018, while the jury in the second trial of the series was considering its verdict.\n\nThe video lasted an hour-and-a-half and was viewed online 250,000 times, after being live-streamed on Facebook.\n\nIn a written ruling, Dame Victoria said Robinson had claimed his intention in making the broadcast was to \"denounce the media\" for their behaviour.\n\nBut the judges found he had encouraged others \"to harass a defendant by finding him, knocking on his door, following him, and watching him\".\n\nThis created \"a real risk that the course of justice would be seriously impeded\", she said.\n\nPossible appeal\n\nRobinson was originally jailed for 13 months on the day of the Facebook broadcast, but was released two months into his sentence after winning an appeal.\n\nThe case was then referred back to Attorney General Geoffrey Cox, who announced, in March this year, that it was in the public interest to bring fresh proceedings.\n\nThe nine month jail sentence served on Thursday includes six months for the Leeds Crown Court offence last year and another three months for contempt of court, following a suspended sentence given at Canterbury Crown Court in May 2017.\n\nAt the Old Bailey on Thursday, Dame Victoria Sharp told Robinson that the time he previously spent behind bars for contempt would be taken into account, reducing his sentence to 19 weeks - of which he would serve half before being released.\n\nRobinson's barrister Richard Furlong raised the possibility of an appeal against the court's decision and was told he has 28 days to apply.\n\nThe attorney general said the sentencing illustrated how seriously the courts would take matters of contempt.\n\n\"I would urge everyone to think carefully about whether their social media posts could amount to contempt of court,\" Mr Cox added.\n\nWhat is contempt of court?\n\nContempt of court laws exist to ensure people have fair trials. The idea is that juries must not be influenced by anything but the evidence they hear in court.\n\nThe rules apply to everyone from journalists to people posting comments on social media, and even jurors.\n\nIf someone interferes with a trial, the defendants can walk free and a new trial may have to be held.\n\nThe maximum sentence for contempt of court is two years in prison, but it can also be punished with an unlimited fine.\n\nContempt includes publishing anything that creates a substantial risk of seriously prejudicing \"active\" criminal proceedings.

Show Hide The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) was formed in 2007 to promote and uphold equality and human rights laws across England, Scotland and Wales. It bought together the work of three previous bodies -the Commission for Racial Equality, the Disability Rights Commission and the Equal Opportunities Commission. The Commission's role includes enforcing equality legislation on 'protected characteristics' - age, disability, gender, marriage, pregnancy, race, religion and sexual orientation. The EHRC's powers range from simply providing advice to organisations, to holding inquiries to ensure that equality laws are enforced and to work towards ending discrimination and harassment. Ultimately the EHRC can take organisations to court in order to force them to comply.\n\nLabour\u2019s deputy leader, Tom Watson, said he and the shadow cabinet had been denied access to information on the scale of the problem and the party\u2019s official response to the investigation by the equalities watchdog.\n\nThe deputy leader said he could not assess whether Panorama exaggerated the scale of antisemitism in the party because he was unable to find out how many complaints had been made.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been told by the general secretary that I\u2019m not legally responsible for dealing with outside regulatory bodies,\u201d Watson said.\n\nMembers of Labour\u2019s governing national executive committee raised serious concerns at a meeting on Tuesday that party chiefs had not shared the submission to the EHRC investigation with its ruling body.\n\nThe submission was to be coordinated by Labour\u2019s in-house counsel Gordon Nardell, but the barrister quit last week after just one year in post to return full-time to his chambers, Twenty Essex, which said it was \u201cdelighted\u201d to welcome him back full-time from August.\n\n\u201cThe party has not grasped the consequences how serious this investigation is if Labour is found guilty, there is no concept of the extremely severe ramifications of that decision,\u201d one source close to the NEC said.\n\n\u201cAt the NEC meeting, neither the EHRC investigation nor Panorama was on the agenda. There was no time to discuss it.\n\n\u201cThis is an extremely serious thing, we are effectively the trustees of the party, and we are being left entirely in the dark about how we respond to this.\u201d\n\nThe body does not have the power to fine or prosecute individuals but it could create a legally enforceable action plan for organisations and make recommendations, if it finds against Labour.\n\nKeir Starmer, a shadow cabinet member, said the party should show it was ready to \u201cthrow open the books and say you have got access to anything\u201d.\n\nNEC members intend to raise the matter again at the meeting of the equalities committee next week and again at a full meeting the following week.\n\nA Labour spokesman said: \u201cThe Labour party is fully committed to the support, defence and celebration of the Jewish community and implacably opposed to antisemitism in any form. Our records show that after Jennie Formby became general secretary, the rate at which antisemitism cases have been dealt with increased more than fourfold.\n\n\n\n\u201cComplaints about antisemitism relate to a small minority of our members. We have robust procedures for dealing with such complaints, which we are continuing to improve and we are cooperating fully with the EHRC.\u201d\n\n\n\nSam Matthews, Labour\u2019s former head of complaints, told Sky News the EHRC would be able to pinpoint those responsible for allowing the issue to escalate, with powers that former staffers would not have.\n\n\u201cWhile I can provide testimony, all the EHRC can do is use their powers to get and reach into the Labour party servers and to Unite servers ... to find if this has happened,\u201d he said. \u201cThe EHRC have the power to find it and they absolutely need to.\u201d\n\n\n\nMatthews, one of the former staffers who also spoke to Panorama, said he believed the process could ultimately end up in court. \u201cI think that where the EHRC get to is ultimately a process that they are going through at the moment but it could end up there,\u201d he said."}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/11/angela-merkel-sits-anthems-after-latest-shaking-episode", "published": "2019-07-11T13:03:42", "title": "Angela Merkel sits for anthems after latest shaking episode", "text": "Angela Merkel sat through the German and Danish national anthems during a ceremony welcoming Denmark\u2019s prime minister to Berlin.

Tall and gregarious, he was nicknamed \u201cKimbo\u201d at the Foreign Office, where he began his civil service career in 1977 and climbed the ranks of diplomacy in postings from Japan to Italy. He entered the public eye when he was frequently seen at Cameron\u2019s side as his national security adviser from 2012 to 2015, joining him on trips to war zones, and chairing meetings on international crises, from Russian aggression in Ukraine to the collapse of the Libyan government. But it is his roles prior to that, as Blair\u2019s top adviser on Europe, and as the permanent representative to the EU under Brown, that led to his vilification by Conservative Brexit supporters, who regard him as an arch Europhile. In January 2016 he took up the role of HM ambassador to the United States. Despite having been appointed when Hillary Clinton was thought likely to win the presidency, Darroch threw himself into courting Trump\u2019s inner circle, \u201cflooding the zone\u201d of people in Trump\u2019s orbit, hoping to gain influence through showing up and cultivating contacts. He also worked hard to court well-connected American journalists so he could benefit from their insights. In July 2019, Darroch resigned as ambassador, after a series of leaked diplomatic messages revealed that he had described the administration as \"inept\" and \"clumsy\". This led to a vocal Twitter outburst from Trump. Darroch could never have imagined that his distinguished 40-year diplomatic career would end with a US president publicly volleying insults his way, calling him \u201ca very stupid guy\u201d, \u201cwacky\u201d and \u201cpompous fool\u201d. Rowena Mason in London and David Smith in Washington Photograph: Niall Carson/PA\n\nThe most vehement criticism came from David Morris, the Conservative MP for Morecambe and Lunesdale, who condemned Johnson for failing to fully back Darroch after Trump insulted the ambassador in tweets and said he would no longer deal with him.\n\nKim Darroch has resigned. Now Britain risks becoming a vassal of the US | Martin Kettle Read more\n\nDarroch is understood to have made the decision to resign after watching Johnson repeatedly declining to offer his support in the debate.\n\n\u201cDo you not feel that it is incumbent on every member of parliament in this place to back up our excellent diplomats and civil servants, and the honourable member for Uxbridge should come to the house and apologise?\u201d Morris asked.\n\nOther Conservatives expressed similar views, with Roger Gale telling the Commons: \u201cThe failure of the former foreign secretary to leap to the defence of Sir Kim shows a lack of leadership that is lamentable.\u201d\n\nThe Tory MP Tom Tugendhat, who chairs the Commons foreign affairs committee, was less direct, but made his feelings known, saying the loss of Darroch following Trump\u2019s comments amounted to the UK being bullied.\n\nTugendhat said the government should \u201calways stand up for those we send abroad, military or civilian, and will back them to the point that is necessary in the interests of the British people, and no one else\u201d.\n\nQuick guide Who could be prosecuted over the leak? Show Hide Who is liable for prosecution under the Official Secrets Act? Most of the offences covered by the legislation affect crown servants and government contractors. Any unlawful disclosure relating to security or intelligence by a member of MI5, MI6 or GCHQ is an offence. Officials do not need to sign the act to be bound by its provisions. The maximum punishment for leaking documents is two years in prison or an unlimited fine. What must be proven to convict a public servant? An official is guilty of a crime if he or she 'without lawful authority makes a damaging disclosure' of information about international relations between states, defence, law enforcement, or which falls into a class of information likely to damage the security services\u2019 work. Leaks are deemed to be damaging if, among other consequences, they 'endanger the interests of the United Kingdom abroad'. There is a defence for any leaker that they released the material not knowing it would be damaging. How often do leaks result in a trial? Prosecutions under the Official Secrets Act are rare. Recent cases have included that of the MI5 agent David Shayler in 2002. He was jailed for six months. In 2007, a Scotland Yard civilian employee, Thomas Lund-Lack, was sentenced to eight months for leaking information on planned al-Qaida operations in Britain to a Sunday Times journalist. A number of cases have involved civil servants who mislaid sensitive information. At least one, Richard Jackson, a Cabinet Office official, was fined \u00a32,500 under the act after he left classified papers relating to al-Qaida and Iraq on a train. Owen Bowcott, Legal affairs correspondent\n\nThe only support for Johnson came from veteran Tory backbencher Peter Bone, who said: \u201cThe attacking of colleagues is completely wrong and people should be ashamed of themselves when they\u2019ve done that.\u201d\n\nThe urgent question was tabled by Labour\u2019s Pat McFadden, who said the decision of Darroch to resign, despite having the full support of Theresa May and her cabinet, was \u201ca dark moment for our democracy and for the standing of the United Kingdom\u201d.\n\nMcFadden said Johnson\u2019s lack of support for the envoy was \u201can appalling abandonment of someone in the firing line\u201d. He added: \u201cReal leaders protect their people, they don\u2019t throw them to the wolves because they can sniff a prize for themselves. His actions are a chilling warning of what is to come if he becomes prime minister.\u201d\n\nDuncan said he would not be responding to such views on Johnson: \u201cI hope the house will understand if I hold back today from making any further comment on the right honourable friend the member for Uxbridge. I said enough yesterday to make my position entirely clear.\u201d\n\nDuncan nonetheless managed to reiterate his condemnation of Johnson several times in ways varying from the oblique to the open.\n\nResponding to one question, he replied: \u201cIt is everyone\u2019s duty, and everyone in this house\u2019s duty, to defend our ambassadors. They are our ambassadors doing our duty. If they do something terribly wrong or break all the rules, that\u2019s altogether different.\u201d\n\nDuncan later drew laughter after the Lib Dem deputy leader, Jo Swinson, cited his description of Johnson\u2019s actions as \u201cthe behaviour of an utter wimp\u201d.\n\n\u201cI seem to recall that was one of the kinder words I used yesterday,\u201d Duncan told MPs, adding: \u201cI think what I would rather do is concentrate on the specific details of the question put, the merits of Sir Kim Darroch rather than the \u2026 merits of anyone else.\u201d"}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2019/jul/11/australia-v-england-cricket-world-cup-2019-semi-final-live", "published": "2019-07-11T14:55:13", "title": "England chasing 224 to beat Australia: Cricket World Cup 2019 semi-final \u2013 live!", "text": "What term do you want to search?

Kamala Harris. Only 57 of 197 GOP legislators \u2014 and only eight Democrats \u2014 present voted against the giveaway.\n\nThe GOP\u2019s House leader, Rep. Kevin McCarthy, voted for the giveaway to Indian outsourcing workers.\n\nThe bill also helps U.S. real-estate investors by extending the green-card giveaway to the Chinese leaders who use the EB-5 program to buy green cards for their families.\n\nThe Senate\u2019s version of the bill was halted in late June when Sen. Rand Paul blocked a \u201cunanimous consent\u201d maneuver by GOP Utah Sen. Mike Lee. But Paul may switch his vote, allowing Lee to repeat his \u201cunanimous consent\u201d maneuver.

The bill would do nothing to move the current employer-sponsored system toward a more merit-based system. The adverse effect on immigrant visa wait times for nationals of countries currently with lesser demand would be an obstacle to any potential plan to promote or increase immigration from countries who immigrants present reduced risk, such as Visa Waiver Program countries, or any other class of countries which the Administration may desire to provide preferential treatment (e.g., countries with which the U.S. has negotiated favorable trade deals).\n\nThe statement was signed by Joseph Joh, Assistant Director and Senior Adviser for the Office of Legislative Affairs at DHS.\n\nJoh\u2019s letter may become irrelevant if business lobbies persuade top White House aides and President Donald Trump to accept the green-card bill as a variety of \u201cmerit-based immigration.\u201d\n\nWhite House officials may also argue the bill has nothing to do with immigration and amnesties, but only deals with visa workers who are supposedly needed by high-tech companies. In practice, there is no shortage of high tech workers\u2013 only a shortage of CEOs and investors willing to spend the money needed to hire some of the many American professionals employed at other companies.\n\nIn the Senate, GOP leaders may choose to block the giveaway bill, in part, because it is being pushed by Sen. Kamala Harris, who may be the Democrats\u2019 challenger in 2020.\n\nEstablishment media outlets almost entirely ignored the HR.1044 bill prior to its approval. After the vote, Tai Kopan, the San Franciso Chronicle\u2019s Washington reporter, praised the House vote even though the legislation would raise the number of Indians seeking to displace the declining share of American graduates in her newspaper\u2019s home district of Silicon Valley:\n\nThink there\u2019s no room for bipartisan agreement on immigration? @ZoeLofgren and @RepKenBuck\u2019s bill to end per-country caps for employment visas (i.e. reduce the backlogs) passed 365-65 today.

Hill staffers reported that the phone lines were clogged by the pro-American groups.\n\nBut there is no sign that the GOP leadership pressured other GOP legislators to vote against the Democrat-corporate legislation.\n\nThe top GOP legislator on the House judiciary committee, Georgia Rep. Doug Collins, announced he would vote against the legislation because it did not go through a process of hearings and votes.\n\nWhip Steve Scalise kept a low profile, and quietly voted against the measure.\n\nMinority Leader Kevin McCarthy voted for the giveaway, which provides a fast-track to green cards for 300,000 Indian contract-workers and 300,000 of their family members who choose to stay and work in the United States after their work visas expired.

McCarthy\u2019s fundraising committees announced the campaign had raised $10.66 million in the second quarter, bringing his total haul for the year thus far to $33.72 million. The success has allowed it to already distribute $8.8 directly to reelection campaigns of members and $10.7 million to the National Republican Congressional Committee and state parties. \u201cThe substantial resources raised thus far will allow us to take our vision and message to the people\u2014and expand the map by outworking, out-recruiting and exposing the corrupt, inept new Democrat socialist party,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cTogether we will restore a government that put America first and every American back on top.\u201d\n\nIn the brief floor debate on Wednesday, GOP legislators repeatedly praised the bill because it helps imported workers, investors, and companies.

What brought her here?\n\nWhat the\u2026?\n\n\u201cNew?\u201d\n\n\u201cVery new?\u201d\n\nOMGLOLLMFAO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nCould someone please inform the liars at Variety that a woman action hero is as old as Pam Grier.\n\nCould someone inform Variety that a woman action hero in a Terminator movie is a 29-year-old idea that reaches all the way back to 1991\u2019s Terminator 2: Judgment Day, where Linda Hamilton kicked all kinds of butt and became one of the most popular and beloved characters in movie history?\n\nWait, I\u2019m not done yet\u2026\n\nCould someone inform Variety that a Lady Terminator is a 16-year-old idea that reaches all the way back to 2003\u2019s Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines.\n\nAnd now we get to my favorite part\u2026\n\nCould someone inform Variety that a Lady Terminator Protector is an 11-year-old idea that reaches all the way back to 2008\u2019s Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles.\n\nThere is nothing, and I mean nothing, new or progressive or envelope pushing about Dark Fate, which is why you hear a collective shrug every time that truly awful trailer plays.\n\nLIE #2:\n\nAn early \u201cDark Fate\u201d poster received backlash, calling Davis and her co-stars \u201cfeminazis\u201d and other chauvinist hate speech. How do you think she\u2019ll be received in the room at Comic-Con?\n\nOther than the awful-ness of the Dark Fate trailer, which has nothing to do with vagina, the only backlash I could find is this\u2026 A handful of nobodies in a country of over 330 million, and if you bother to click on the actual examples, you will find that even this is fake news because three of the seven \u201csexist\u201d examples have nothing to do with vagina.\n\nLIE #3:\n\nIf you\u2019re at all enlightened, she\u2019ll play like gangbusters.\n\nOh, so if we don\u2019t like a particular actress, it has nothing to do with the director making a terrible choice and everything to do with our lack of enlightenment, which now forces me to admit one of those things you are definitely not supposed to admit to in 21st century America.\n\nMy problem with Mackenzie Davis in this role (she was great in AMC\u2019s Halt and Catch Fire) is not that she\u2019s a girl, it\u2019s that she looks like a 14-year-old boy.\n\nIf Dark Fate\u2019s Lady Terminator had a woman\u2019s body instead of a Cub Scout\u2019s body, I\u2019d be much more excited about this whole thing.\n\nIf Dark Fate\u2019s Lady Terminator looked more like Charlize Theron and less like Crispin Glover, I\u2019d be the first in line.\n\nHey, don\u2019t get mad, and don\u2019t you dare question my sexual preferences\u2026\n\nI was born this way.\n\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

A year later, Fox News reported that flight records showed President Clinton had flown at least 26 times on Mr. Epstein\u2019s plane. It was unclear how many individual flights were involved in each trip that Mr. Ure\u00f1a mentioned and whether that may account for the discrepancy between the number he cited and what the flight logs show. Mr. Clinton\u2019s office did not immediately respond for a request for comment. The flight logs, posted online by Gawker, also record Mr. Clinton as being present on a domestic flight from Miami to Westchester County Airport in West Harrison, N.Y., which is near Mr. Clinton\u2019s home in suburban Chappaqua.\n\nClinton\u2019s statement does not mention some of the trips reportedly encompassed multiple legs with several other possible flights.\n\nThe Asia trip alone, which flight records show occurred between May 22 and May 25, 2002, was reportedly a five-leg trip.\n\nAccording to Fox News, flight records show Clinton flying to such destinations as \u201cHong Kong, Japan, Singapore, China, Brunei, London, New York, the Azores, Belgium, Norway, Russia and Africa.\u201d\n\nThe New York Times story did not note Clinton\u2019s statement further leaves out that the former president was reportedly on the airplane with Epstein himself.\n\nThe statement that \u201cin 2002 and 2003, President Clinton took a total of four trips on Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s airplane\u201d seems to imply that Clinton utilized the airplane itself but conspicuously fails to mention whether Epstein was onboard. According to numerous reports, Clinton was a frequent flyer on the pervert\u2019s private airplane, traveling with Epstein and unidentified women numerous times.\n\nEpstein\u2019s fleet reportedly included a Boeing 727-200 passenger jet that normally seats nearly 200 but was modified for private use. Fox News reported Epstein\u2019s plane was \u201coutfitted with a bed where passengers had group sex with young girls.\u201d\n\nNewsweek reported on a previous Gawker story exposing flight logs showing Clinton and Epstein on one flight with a softcore porn actress while other trips were allegedly shared with women listed on flight manifests without their full names.\n\nNewsweek reported:\n\nIn 2015, Gawker released the flight logbooks for Epstein\u2019s Gulfstream and the Lolita Express 727. Bill Clinton is among the prominent people listed in the flight logs, having took several trips on the Lolita Express with a softcore porn actress listed under \u201cmassages\u201d in Epstein\u2019s address book, also published by Gawker. Clinton shared eleven flights aboard the Lolita Express with Maxwell and Epstein\u2019s former assistant Sarah Kellen, who has been accused in court filings of recruiting young girls, acting as a pimp on Epstein\u2019s behalf. On multiple flights, additional women, listed in the flight logs by their first name or the simple descriptor \u201cfemale,\u201d joined Clinton aboard Epstein\u2019s plane.\n\nClinton, meanwhile, has a long history of credibility issues regarding claims about his mistreatment of women.\n\nClinton famously claimed of Monica Lewinsky, \u201cI did not have sexual relations with that woman,\u201d but was later impeached by the House of Representatives for lying under oath about this relationship with the White House intern. He also denied credible sexual assault accusations from Juanita Broaddrick, Paula Jones and Kathleen Willey, among others.\n\nAaron Klein is Breitbart\u2019s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

(Daniel Jayo/Getty Images)\n\nAfter the killing in October of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul, a handful of lobbying firms and think tanks made a move rare in Washington: They publicly severed ties with Saudi Arabia, swearing off the kingdom\u2019s money.\n\nBut nine months later, Saudi Arabia\u2019s efforts to influence U.S. policy continue unabated \u2014 bolstered by President Trump\u2019s embrace of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, despite a recent United Nations report that the prince was complicit in the grisly killing and dismemberment of the Washington Post contributing columnist and political dissident.\n\nSince fall 2018, high-powered lobbyists and lawyers have reaped millions of dollars for assisting the kingdom as it works to develop nuclear power, buy American-made weapons and prolong U.S. assistance to the Saudi-led coalition waging war in Yemen, foreign lobbying records show.\n\nOne Washington-based communications firm \u2014 whose parent company initially expressed concern when Khashoggi disappeared \u2014 recently reported collecting nearly $19 million for what it says was several years of work for the Saudi government. A New York-based public relations firm run by a former Clinton administration appointee signed on in February to represent a Saudi interest for as much as $120,000 a month, filings show.\n\nThe firms representing the kingdom operate under wide political cover provided by Trump. The president posed for photos with Mohammed on the sidelines of the Group of 20 summit in Japan late last month, calling him \u201cmy friend.\u201d When asked about Khashoggi\u2019s murder, Trump has repeatedly emphasized the economic benefits of the U.S.-Saudi relationship.\n\n\u201cTake their money,\u201d he said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d last month, describing his posture toward the kingdom. \u201cTake their money.\u201d\n\nOn Oct. 2, 2018, Saudi agents killed Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi inside the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul. What has been done to hold those responsible accountable? (Joyce Lee,Thomas LeGro,Dalton Bennett,John Parks/The Washington Post)\n\nShaped by a sophisticated influence machine that was built over decades, Saudi support on Capitol Hill has been tested in recent months amid international outrage over Khashoggi\u2019s death and a war in Yemen that has killed tens of thousands of civilians and led to massive hunger.\n\nAnd last month, the United Nations released a report on a months-long investigation that found \u201ccredible evidence\u201d that top Saudi officials, including Mohammed, were liable for Khashoggi\u2019s murder. The report reinforced the conclusions of U.S. intelligence officials, who concluded that Mohammed ordered the assassination.\n\nSaudi officials have dismissed both the CIA\u2019s claims and the U.N. findings, saying the U.N. report contained \u201ccontradictions and baseless allegations.\u201d\n\n[U.N. investigator calls for probe of Saudi officials in Khashoggi killing]\n\nLast week, the lead U.N. investigator said the international community should impose \u201cpolitical accountability\u201d by quashing Saudi Arabia\u2019s plan to host the next G-20 meeting in Riyadh, the Saudi capital.\n\nIn recent months, some Republicans have joined Democrats in trying to limit U.S. military aid and weapon sales to Saudi Arabia. But with billions of dollars at stake, the powerful defense industry has helped the Saudi lobbying corps contain Republican defections. Congressional votes in recent months have fallen short of majorities needed to override the president\u2019s vetoes.\n\n\u201cThe Saudis lost some lobbyists last year, but the firms they still have working for them went into overdrive,\u201d said Ben Freeman, who tracks foreign influence for the Center for International Policy, a left-leaning think tank. \u201cAs long as Trump remains on their side, they are going to get their arms and have U.S. involvement in Yemen. So there\u2019s still no real punishment for them, and the lobby is a key part of making that happen.\u201d\n\nThe Saudi Embassy in Washington did not respond to requests for comment.\n\n\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo meets with Mohammed in Riyadh on Oct. 16, 2018. Jamal Khashoggi was killed two weeks earlier. (Leah Mills/Pool/AP)\n\n\u2018A valuable ally\u2019\n\nSaudi Arabia has found new boosters in the United States since Khashoggi\u2019s murder. Its sovereign wealth fund \u2014 which is chaired by the crown prince \u2014 in February hired Karv Communications, a New York public relations firm run by Andrew Frank, who worked at the United States Information Agency in the Clinton administration.\n\nThe public relations firm is tasked with creating a distinction between the fund\u2019s \u201cinvestment-driven mission and the political leadership in Saudi Arabia\u201d and preparing for \u201cpotential negative developments,\u201d according to the contract, which was filed publicly.\n\nFrank said his firm is not lobbying members of Congress. \u201cOur role is to build bridges,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re on the economic side and not doing political outreach, period.\u201d\n\nSo far, Karv Communications has been paid $342,000 by the fund, as well as being given the gift of a foosball table, lobbying records show.\n\nSaudi Arabia is one of the highest-spending countries seeking to influence U.S. policy, ranking fifth in an analysis by the Center for Responsive Politics that reviewed the flow of foreign money from 2017 to the present.\n\nRoughly 20 firms are registered to lobby for Saudi interests, compared with more than 25 before Khashoggi\u2019s death, foreign lobbying filings show.\n\nLobbyists for Saudi Arabia tout the country\u2019s role as a key U.S. partner in combating terrorism at a time of mounting tensions with Iran. Saudi Arabia was the first country to sign on to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo\u2019s plan for allies to help outfit tankers with cameras to monitor threats from Iran, following the shooting down of a U.S. drone on June 20.\n\nOne lobbyist for the kingdom said that making a case on Capitol Hill for his client is not difficult.\n\n\u201cIt is undeniable that they are a valuable ally, a very important strategic asset in the Middle East and a counterweight to Iran,\u201d said Alfred Mottur, a senior partner at Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck, a leading Washington lobbying firm that Saudi Arabia has paid $1.5 million since October, filings show.\n\nWhen reports emerged that Khashoggi may have been killed during his visit to the Saudi Consulate on Oct. 2, some longtime lobbyists expressed concern. Among them was MSL, the parent company of Qorvis Communications, a Washington-based crisis communications firm that has worked for the kingdom since the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks.\n\nHatice Cengiz told The Post she wishes she could share these thoughts with her fiance, Jamal Khashoggi, who was murdered in the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2 while she waited outside. The CIA has concluded that the Saudi crown prince ordered the killing of the outspoken democracy activist and Post contributor. (REF:woodsomek,REF:leej3,REF:carrollj,REF:yij/The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cWe take the situation seriously and wait for all the facts to become known,\u201d the company said in a statement at the time.\n\nInside the firm, there were disagreements over how to proceed in the wake of the killing, according to former employees. But ultimately, MSL and Qorvis continued working for the Saudi government.\n\nAmong the firms registered to lobby in the United States on behalf of the kingdom, MSL has reported receiving the most money since October: $18.8 million.\n\nMichael Petruzzello, president of Qorvis Communications, said the money was for work \u201cbilled over several years and recently paid all at once.\u201d He declined to comment on the firm\u2019s decision to continue to represent Saudi Arabia after Khashoggi\u2019s murder.\n\nPublic filings show that MSL/Qorvis made dozens of contacts in the past six months with media outlets and think tanks \u2014 including the Brookings Institution and the Middle East Institute, which said after Khashoggi\u2019s death that they would no longer accept Saudi funding. MSL\u2019s work related to U.S. relations with Saudi Arabia and policy on Yemen, according to the filings, which do not specifically mention Khashoggi. A Brookings official acknowledged receiving Saudi-related requests for meetings from MSL/Qorvis in recent months but said the think tank declined to participate.\n\nAt least five firms did end up cutting business ties with Saudi interests in the fall: Glover Park Group, BGR Group, Harbour Group, CGCN Group and Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, filings show.\n\n[Two more Washington lobbying firms drop representation of Saudi Arabia in wake of alleged killing of Jamal Khashoggi]\n\nAmong the lobbying firms still representing Saudi interests are Hogan Lovells, which has been paid $1.6 million since fall; and McKeon Group, led by Howard \u201cBuck\u201d McKeon, a former Republican chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, which has received $600,000.\n\nTwo law firms are offering advice on the kingdom\u2019s efforts to build nuclear power plants: Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman, which got nearly $1.9 million between August 2018 and January; and King & Spalding, which received $946,000 in November.\n\nAll the firms either declined to comment or did not respond to inquiries.\n\n\n\nPresident Trump meets with Mohammed, center, in the Oval Office at the White House on March 14, 2017. Vice President Pence is at right. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nClose ties to Trump\n\nThe kingdom\u2019s standing in Washington has been reinforced by the relationship between the crown prince and Jared Kushner, a senior White House adviser and Trump\u2019s son-in-law. Mohammed and Kushner, both in their 30s, have worked together closely since early in the administration, a relationship that helped lead Trump to make Saudi Arabia the destination for his first foreign trip as president.\n\nFormer secretary of state Rex Tillerson told the House Foreign Affairs Committee in May that Kushner cut him and other top diplomats out of talks with Saudi rulers, including the crown prince. \u201cI was certainly aware that there was a lot of communication between the two of them,\u201d Tillerson said, referring to Kushner and Mohammed.\n\n[Two princes: Kushner now faces a reckoning for Trump\u2019s bet on the heir to the Saudi throne]\n\nKushner said in April at a Time magazine forum that he did not \u201cdispute American intelligence services\u2019 recommendations\u201d regarding Khashoggi\u2019s murder. A spokesman for Kushner did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe Saudi government and its lobbyists have also been clients of the Trump International Hotel in Washington.\n\nLobbyists with MSL/Qorvis booked 500 rooms over three months at the hotel after the 2016 election as the firm brought U.S. military veterans to Washington to speak out against a terrorism law the Saudis opposed, as The Washington Post has previously reported.\n\nSeparately, two members of the Saudi government\u2019s Capital Market Authority \u2014 including the nation\u2019s top financial regulator \u2014 stayed at the hotel in February 2018, according to guest information obtained by The Post.\n\nMohammed El Kuwaiz, the chairman of the Capital Market Authority and a leader in the Saudi government\u2019s efforts to integrate the kingdom into the global economy, was a guest at the hotel on Feb. 1, along with another official from the group, Hanan Alshehri, the records show.\n\nThe Saudi authority did not respond to questions about how many nights its officials have stayed at the hotel or how much money they have spent there. The Trump Organization, which says it directs its profit from foreign governments to the U.S. Treasury, did not respond to an inquiry about how it handled the visits by the Saudi officials.\n\nIn May, shortly after Kuwaiz\u2019s stay, the public relations firm Hill and Knowlton Strategies helped prepare him for a speech at a Bloomberg financial conference and for an announcement related to MSCI Inc., a stock market index, according to a public filing. Earlier this year, after a two-year push, Saudi stocks were included in the MSCI index for the first time, boosting the value of many companies.\n\nHill and Knowlton, which has received about $680,000 from two Saudi entities since June, declined to comment.\n\nTrump\u2019s staunch support for Saudi Arabia was on display at the recent G-20 summit of world leaders in Osaka, where the president said he was \u201cvery angry\u201d about Khashoggi\u2019s murder but declined to pin responsibility on the crown prince.\n\nTrump\u2019s remarks commending the crown prince for combating extremism and improving opportunities for women drew praise from Ali Shihabi, founder of the Arabia Foundation, a think tank that says it does not receive money from the Saudi government.\n\n\u201cHe understands that it\u2019s idiotic to focus on one issue only namely the Khashoggi tragedy,\u201d Shihabi said last month of the president on Twitter.\n\n\n\nA protest sign designed as a street sign and reading \u201cKhashoggi Way\u201d is seen across from the White House in December. (ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nA divide in Congress\n\nWhile the Senate voted in December to directly condemn Mohammed over Khashoggi\u2019s death, it has not followed up with threatened sanctions.\n\nSen. Mitt Romney (Utah), the GOP presidential nominee in 2012 and an occasional Trump critic, revived the idea recently after the president called it \u201can honor\u201d to meet with the crown prince at the G-20.\n\n\u201cThe President\u2019s praise for MBS, the man who US intel says ordered or authorized the heinous murder of a WaPo columnist & Saudi dissident, sends the wrong message to the world,\u201d he posted on Twitter. \u201cIt\u2019s past time for Congress & the administration to impose sanctions for the murder of Jamal Khashoggi.\u201d\n\nHowever, Romney was the only Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to reject a measure on June 25 that was intended to make it harder for the president to avoid congressional review of arms sales.\n\n\u201cEnding support of the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen would undermine U.S. security interests in the region and embolden Iran,\u201d Romney said in a statement. \u201cAt the same time, we must take action to hold Saudi Arabia accountable for the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, press the Saudis to advance human rights, and insist that Saudi Arabia act to stop the spread of extremism in the region.\u201d\n\nRomney\u2019s straddle reflects the traction the kingdom continues to have on Capitol Hill as it positions itself as the most important counterweight to Iran.\n\nThe military conflict that has ravaged Yemen, one of the world\u2019s poorest countries, pits the exiled Yemeni government backed by Saudi Arabia against the Houthi rebels aligned with Iran. U.S. assistance to the Saudi-led military coalition, which began in 2015 under President Barack Obama, includes providing aerial refueling for coalition warplanes and assisting with intelligence and logistical support.\n\nEconomic measures, largely imposed by the Saudi-led military coalition, have helped create what the United Nations has called the world\u2019s worst ongoing humanitarian catastrophe. Weapons produced by American companies have been tied to some of the most horrific civilian deaths in Yemen, including an airstrike that killed at least 40 children riding in a school bus for a field trip and an attack that killed 22 people attending a wedding.\n\nConcerns over the U.S. hand in the carnage led the Senate last month to vote to bar Trump from using his emergency authority to complete $8 billion in arms sales benefiting Saudi Arabia and its close ally, the United Arab Emirates. The House is expected to take similar action this month.\n\n\u201cSaudi Arabia\u2019s actions in Yemen and the Khashoggi murder and attempted coverup heavily shape congressional views,\u201d said Sen. Jack Reed (R.I.), the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee and a co-sponsor of the resolution of disapproval.\n\nHowever, the Senate measure did not pass with a veto-proof majority \u2014 and Trump has vowed to veto it. Pro-Saudi interests have tried to shift blame for the violence in Yemen to the Houthi rebels, have emphasized the kingdom\u2019s humanitarian assistance and have pointed to threats posed by Iran.\n\nOn March 20, Republican Sens. Lisa Murkowski (Alaska), Susan Collins (Maine), Jerry Moran (Kan.) and Steve Daines (Mont.) received an email from former senator Norm Coleman (R-Minn.), now a lobbyist at Hogan Lovells, addressing their \u201cdeep concerns regarding the humanitarian crisis in Yemen.\u201d Coleman declined to comment.\n\nSeparately, the McKeon Group distributed a thick report listing 1,091 acts of Houthi violence during a cease-fire in December and January, as well as news releases from the Saudi Embassy in Washington promoting the Saudi government\u2019s efforts to promote the delivery of food and medical supplies in Yemen. The McKeon Group\u2019s recent contacts with Senate Republicans on behalf of Saudi Arabia included Romney and James M. Inhofe (Okla.), both of whom voted against blocking the weapon sales.\n\nA spokeswoman for Inhofe said his \u201cvotes have always been based on his concern about checking Iranian influence in the region, protecting American service members and not expanding the definition of \u2018hostilities.\u2019 \u201d\n\nDaines, who voted to end U.S. engagement in Yemen, also backed the weapon sales to Saudi Arabia.\n\n\u201cWith Iran\u2019s recent aggressive actions, the Senator believes it\u2019s critical we work with our allies in the region to counter Iran\u2019s support of terror around the world and any effort to develop nuclear weapons,\u201d Daines spokeswoman Julia Doyle said in a statement.\n\nSen. Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.), a frequent defender of the president, has been one of the few Republican lawmakers to publicly cite the U.N. report linking the Saudi royal family to Khashoggi\u2019s murder. He directly condemned the crown prince during a recent confirmation hearing for Kelly Craft, Trump\u2019s nominee to be the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no amount of oil coming out of Saudi Arabia and there\u2019s no threat from Iran that\u2019s going to get me back on,\u201d Graham said. \u201cThere is a price.\u201d\n\n\n\nTrump and Mohammed shake hands at the G-20 summit in Osaka, Japan, on June 28, 2019.

(Kevin Sieff/The Washington Post)\n\nWhen the United States began sending asylum seekers to wait in Mexico earlier this year as their claims were processed, many regarded the dangerous northeastern state of Tamaulipas as a worst-case scenario.\n\nThe State Department warns against all travel to Tamaulipas \u2014 the same risk level it has assigned Syria and Afghanistan. Doctors Without Borders reports that 45 percent of its recent patients in this city, among the largest in the state, were migrants who had \u201csuffered at least one episode of violence\u201d while waiting here to cross the U.S. border.\n\nBut on Tuesday morning, the United States sent the first 12 migrants back to Tamaulipas under a program known as the Migration Protection Protocols. Mexican authorities dismissed the group from Nuevo Laredo\u2019s immigration office without any transportation or assistance.\n\n\u201cWhere do we go?\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Luis Romero, 31, who had fled Venezuela with his wife and two sons, ages 6 and 8. \u201cWe gave away our mattresses.\u201d\n\nThe family had waited for three months in Nuevo Laredo before U.S. officials called for them Monday morning and took them across the border to Laredo, Tex. Romero was separated from his wife and children, and immigration officials interviewed the couple separately. The two explained how they had protested Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro in the city of Maracaibo and how security forces had later raided their home.\n\nOn Tuesday \u2014 after their interviews, without warning \u2014 they were shipped back across the border with their children, their next court date scheduled for Sept. 24.\n\n\n\nAn asylum hearing for Romero, his wife and children is scheduled for Sept. 24, when they will be briefly allowed to cross again into the United States. (Kevin Sieff/The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cNo one told us they would send us back here to wait,\u201d Romero said.\n\nHe and his family dragged their luggage through the streets for a few blocks. It was 97 degrees at 11 a.m. For months, he had tried to keep a low profile here after hearing of other migrants being kidnapped. Now he was left to find a new place to stay. The other returnees \u2014 all Cubans \u2014 had headed off in a different direction.\n\n\u201cI was told not to talk to anyone because of my accent, not to leave the shelter, because we are targets,\u201d Romero said.\n\n[Trump announces migration deal with Mexico, averting threatened tariffs]\n\nFor months, the city\u2019s shelters had been overflowing. Some migrants who left to work or buy food were seized by armed groups. Aaron Mendez Ruiz, who runs a shelter called Amar, said 15 migrants from the facility have been kidnapped this year. One was a Cuban man, Carlos Cordero Roque, 31, who was released Sunday night with bruises lining his back.\n\nRecently, the armed men have been demanding payments of $5,000 from migrants, assuming their relatives in the United States will pay. Roque was held for two weeks before the money arrived, he said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no question that they specifically go after the migrants,\u201d Ruiz said.\n\nEventually, on Tuesday, Romero called the manager of a different migrant shelter who sent a white truck to pick up the family from a street corner.\n\nThe Trump administration developed the Migrant Protection Protocols program to reduce the number of migrants who live and work in the United States while they wait for their asylum hearings \u2014 in some cases for years as a result of the backlog in U.S. asylum courts.\n\nBy June, 11,000 migrants had been sent back to Mexico, mostly to Tijuana and Ciudad Juarez, to await hearings. But the U.S.-Mexico migration deal last month has allowed for the program\u2019s rapid expansion.\n\nMexican officials said they expected tens of thousands of asylum seekers to be returned over the next several months. There was no way to accommodate them, they said, without launching the program in Tamaulipas, where migrants have been targeted for years.\n\nIn 2010, 72 migrants were killed in San Fernando, in rural Tamaulipas. Police found their decomposing bodies and later accused the criminal syndicate Los Zetas of the killings.\n\nState officials voiced outrage at the new U.S. policy.\n\nTamaulipas \u201cwill not be a crossing point for returned asylum seekers,\u201d the governor, Francisco Javier Garc\u00eda Cabeza de Vaca, said in a statement on Monday.\n\n\u201cOur shelters are already overwhelmed,\u201d Ra\u00fal C\u00e1rdenas, the city manager of Nuevo Laredo, said in an interview. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the resources to handle this.\u201d\n\nCabeza de Vaca and officials in Nuevo Laredo threatened to send the migrants to a different state, farther from the border. They complained that Mexico\u2019s federal government had signed a deal with the Trump administration without consulting or assisting the border states involved.\n\n\u201cWe think it would be better to create a shelter 30 or 50 miles south,\u201d said Salvador Rosas, a congressman from Tamaulipas.\n\n[Border arrests drop as Mexico\u2019s migration crackdown appears to cut crossings]\n\nOn Tuesday, Tamaulipas officials suggested that such a shelter could be built in the city of Colombia in the neighboring state of Nuevo Le\u00f3n, 30 miles northwest of Laredo, Tex.\n\nThat plan would complicate the legal process for asylum seekers, who already struggle to find immigration attorneys willing to travel to Nuevo Laredo. The Department of Homeland Security gives returnees a list of lawyers in South Texas, but many say they are unwilling to meet with clients in Nuevo Laredo because of security concerns.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know any pro bono immigration lawyers who are ready to tend to this group,\u201d said Nelly Vielma, an immigration attorney and a Laredo City Council member. \u201cRight now, we are trying to figure out if we can handle some of the cases over Skype.\u201d\n\nJulieta Vences, who leads the migration caucus in Mexico\u2019s National Congress, said no migrants would be forced to leave Tamaulipas. But the state and city governments control how and where resources are distributed to migrants.\n\nWhile President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador has spoken about the need to respect migrants\u2019 rights, his administration so far has done little to assist those waiting in northern Mexico.\n\nThis city\u2019s largest migrant encampment is a telling example. It is a municipal homeless shelter, where asylum seekers are allowed to sleep in a parking lot \u2014 if they can afford their own tents. Food is not provided. Other shelters, such as Amar, are funded by religious charities.\n\nL\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s administration has said it is aware of poor conditions in migrant shelters and is working to improve them.\n\n[How Mexico talked Trump out of tariff threat with immigration crackdown pact]\n\nAuthorities here appeared unprepared to handle the return of asylum seekers, telling Romero and the others they would have to try their best to find a place to stay.\n\nLater on Tuesday, Romero was able to return to the small apartment in Nuevo Laredo he had rented for six weeks, for $100 a month, before he and his family were called across the border. Unlike many asylum seekers, he has relatives in the United States who can send him money.\n\nThe Mexican government issued him a work visa, he said, fulfilling a L\u00f3pez Obrador pledge to allow migrants to earn money while awaiting their court dates in the United States. But Romero has no intention of using it.\n\n\u201cAs dangerous as this city is, I\u2019m not going outside unless I have to,\u201d he said.\n\nRead more\n\nAt border, grim realities of crisis collide with 2020 campaign politics\n\nLawmakers condemn \u2018vulgar\u2019 posts in secret border agent Facebook group\n\nAs Trump administration pushes to return more migrants to Mexico, legal battle over policy intensifies\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news"}, {"link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/the-us-uk-special-relationship-is-in-tatters-after-resignation-of-british-ambassador/2019/07/10/86fdea4a-a335-11e9-b732-41a79c2551bf_story.html", "published": "2019-07-10T11:55:00", "title": "The U.S.-U.K. \u2018special relationship\u2019 is in tatters after the resignation of British ambassador", "text": "The once \u201cspecial relationship\u201d between the United States and Great Britain is in tatters, shredded by the fallout from the 2016 Brexit referendum and President Trump\u2019s determination to intervene in the politics of another country. If it improves, it likely will be on terms set by the president.\n\nWednesday\u2019s resignation under fire by Kim Darroch, the British ambassador to the United States, represents a new low point in recent relations between the two countries. Leaked cables from Darroch back to his government that included critical comments about Trump and his administration were the ambassador\u2019s undoing. Trump saw an opportunity to embarrass the British government and drive the wedge more firmly between the two countries.\n\nDarroch\u2019s resignation has caused an understandable uproar in Britain. Ahead of his decision to resign, he received strong support from outgoing Prime Minister Theresa May. In the aftermath of his letter of resignation, he has received an outpouring of praise from many others in the government, who said he had acted with utmost professionalism in providing candid analysis of the state of affairs in Washington. They blamed the leaker for taking revenge against the government.\n\n[British Ambassador Kim Darroch\u2019s resignation puts other diplomats on notice]\n\nBut what Darroch lacked, in the face of the attacks from Trump, was a strong endorsement from the man now favored to succeed May at No. 10 Downing Street. Boris Johnson, the former mayor of London and former foreign secretary, is the odds-on favorite to win the race for leadership of the Conservative Party against Jeremy Hunt, the current foreign secretary.\n\nIn a leadership debate, Johnson demurred when asked about Darroch\u2019s status and what it might be under a Johnson government. With Trump declaring that he would no longer do business with Darroch, and Johnson declining to give the ambassador stand-up backing, Darroch was left with no choice but to leave. His resignation only highlights the deterioration of the relationship between the two countries since Trump took office.\n\n\n\nBritish Prime Minister Theresa May and President Trump have had a stormy relationship from the start. Trump has repeatedly denigrated May over her handling of Brexit, the referendum that called for the United Kingdom to leave the European Union. (Ben Stansall/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nNigel Sheinwald, a former British ambassador to the United States, called Trump\u2019s treatment of Darroch \u201cvindictive and undignified,\u201d adding that the president has repeatedly taken advantage of a government weakened by the Brexit stalemate.\n\n\u201cThis would never have happened under any other presidency in modern times and it shows the strains in the U.K.-U.S. relationship,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump and May have had a stormy relationship from the start. British officials, including Darroch, worked hard to make certain she was the first foreign leader to visit Trump in the White House as a way to highlight tight U.S.-British ties. British officials, including Darroch, carefully planned Trump\u2019s last two visits to the United Kingdom to minimize friction between the two principals and maximize the pomp and ceremony to emphasize the long-standing friendship between the countries.\n\nOn a personal level, however, Trump repeatedly denigrated May, primarily over Brexit, the referendum that called for the United Kingdom to leave the European Union. He has criticized her negotiating tactics with E.U. leaders, offered his own strategy as superior and undercut her whenever it suited him, including in the past few days as the Darroch controversy was unfolding.\n\n[Darroch resigns as British ambassador over leaked memos, cables]\n\n\n\nIf he succeeds May, Boris Johnson, former U.K. foreign secretary and the favorite to win the race for leadership of the Conservative Party, will start on more solid ground with Trump than May has had. (Henry Nicholls/Bloomberg News)\n\nHis up-and-down relationship with May stands in contrast to that of recent past presidents, who have enjoyed strong bonds with their British counterparts. Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher occasionally sparred but were united in their conservative visions and their views of the then-Soviet Union during the Cold War.\n\nBill Clinton and Tony Blair formed a partnership to advance centrist remakes of their political parties and tie their countries together. They were modernizers who brought their parties back to power and sought to spread the New Democrat and New Labour gospel elsewhere.\n\nWhen America was attacked on Sept. 11, 2001, Blair was the first foreign leader to speak with President George W. Bush by telephone, and he offered unwavering support to Britain\u2019s ally. Blair remained steadfast in his support of Bush\u2019s subsequent policies, including the invasion of Iraq in 2003, something that has tarnished the legacies of both leaders but especially Blair\u2019s back home in Britain.\n\nTrump has followed a different script. He and the Brexiteers are cut from similar cloth \u2014 outsiders who tapped populist and anti-elite sentiment in their countries to upend and ultimately remake the politics on both sides of the Atlantic. Which is why he has been friendly with Nigel Farage, who led the pro-Leave forces during the Brexit referendum.\n\nMore importantly, over the course of his presidency, Trump has played nice with Johnson \u2014 and Johnson has responded in kind. On the eve of his visit to Britain a year ago, the president offered praise for Johnson as a possible future prime minister in an interview with a British newspaper, publication of which caused huge embarrassment for May. Even then, Johnson was angling to oust May.\n\nJohnson, whose tenure as foreign secretary drew widespread criticism, will start on more solid ground with Trump than May has had. But will it continue? If he becomes prime minister, he will have to navigate a strategy for leaving the E.U. that eluded May. He has been equivocal during the campaign debates about just how he would do that.\n\n[Read Ambassador Kim Darroch\u2019s letter of resignation]\n\nMay announced her decision to step down in June. After several elimination rounds of voting by Conservative members of Parliament, Johnson and Hunt emerged as the finalists. The winner will be chosen by rank-and-file Conservative Party members across Britain, with voting now underway. Balloting closes July 21, with the winner expected to be announced July 23.\n\nIf Johnson becomes leader and therefore the new prime minister, his selection of a new ambassador will be a telling indicator. Will he select someone political to appease Trump, or will he appoint a career Foreign Service officer, someone who will send a signal to his entire diplomatic corps that he believes in unvarnished private analysis, even while maintaining cordial relations with the administration?\n\nThere is no easy path, given the divisions in Britain today. Brexit has split the country in two, Leavers and Remainers. That division often overrides traditional left-right differences between the two major parties. Both Labour and Conservatives are split between their pro- and anti-Brexit factions, and the European elections at least showed greater support for the lesser parties, who had clear positions on Brexit, rather than the traditional major parties.\n\nBritain has until the end of October to find a path out of the E.U. or face the prospect of a no-deal departure. Once out of the E.U., Britain wants and needs a trade relationship with the United States. Johnson may believe he can strike that deal with Trump better than anyone else. Perhaps he is right, but it is placing a bet on the president that comes with substantial risk.\n\nDarroch\u2019s resignation has forced a moment of reflection, a moment of reckoning, in the relationship between the longtime allies. The traditional ties \u2014 cooperation on defense and intelligence issues, cultural relations and all the rest \u2014 will continue apace. British and U.S. government officials will do their work as they have tried to do it for years, cordially and professionally.\n\nBut with Trump in the White House and operating as no president has before \u2014 throwing his weight around to try to force other independent actors to do what he wants \u2014 and with Brexit still unresolved and now the major fault line in British politics, the relationship between the two countries faces a period of severe strain and possible remaking. Right now, Trump appears to have the upper hand in all this, and it will be left to the next leader of Britain to find that country\u2019s new equilibrium."}, {"link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/iran-says-will-not-reverse-decision-to-boost-uranium-enrichment-as-french-envoy-visits-tehran/2019/07/10/781d59e4-a2f3-11e9-bd56-eac6bb02d01d_story.html", "published": "2019-07-10T16:21:00", "title": "U.S. accuses Iran of \u2018nuclear extortion\u2019 at emergency meeting of atomic energy watchdog", "text": "Secretary of Iran\u2019s Supreme National Security Council Ali Shamkhani, right, welcomes French presidential envoy Emmanuel Bonne in Tehran on July 10, 2019.

Then we can take necessary measures,\u201d Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said on the sidelines of the Iranian cabinet meeting, according to Mehr.\n\nOn Twitter, Zarif said the United States \u201chas no standing to raise JCPOA issues.\u201d\n\nThe United States \u201cabhors JCPOA, axed & violates it, and punishes all who observe it,\u201d he wrote.\n\nRead more:\n\nWhat is the Iran nuclear deal, and why do some fear Trump\u2019s rejection of it could lead to war?\n\nHow long can Europe maintain its balancing act between the U.S. and Iran?\n\nBritish marines seize tanker suspected of carrying Iranian oil bound for Syria\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news"}]}}}
